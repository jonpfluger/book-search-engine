# Book Search Engine

## Description

Most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. The ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. As user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

This application is a Google Books API search engine. I refactored the RESTful API into a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Allows users to save book searches to the back end.

## Technologies Used

- React
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- GraphQL
- Apollo Server
- Apollo Client
- Node.js/Express.js
